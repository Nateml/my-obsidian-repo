# Structure of RNA

RNA is single stranded with a sugar phosphate backbone. RNA, much like DNA, consists of nucleotides which are comprised of one of four nitrogenous bases, a five-carbon sugar and a phosphate group. However, the bases in RNA slightly differ from the bases in DNA.

Nitrogenous bases found in RNA:
1. Adenine
2. Uracil (instead of thymine)
3. Guanine
4. Cytosine

Adenine and uracil are complimentary.
Guanine and cytosine are complimentary.
