# Survival of the Fittest

The idea in [Natural Selection](Natural%20Selection.md) theory that the organisms most suited to their environment will survive and produce more offspring thus increasing the prevalence of the responsible gene in the gene pool, while those with traits less favorable in their environment will be more likely to die and produce less offspring. We know about genes now, however when natural selection was first proposed genes were yet to be discovered.
