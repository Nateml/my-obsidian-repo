# Central Dogma of Molecular Biology

The central dogma explains how genetic information is turned into functional protein. First proposed by [Francis Crick](Francis%20Crick.md) in 1958.

DNA turns into RNA which is used to make a function protein. RNA acts as a messenger in this process. The process by which DNA is converted to a protein is called **gene expression**, which consists of two key stages: transcription and translation. DNA is transcribed into RNA which travels outside of the nucleus and gets "translated" by ribosomes into amino acids which form proteins. For more detailed information on how this process works, see [Protein Synthesis](Protein%20Synthesis.md).
