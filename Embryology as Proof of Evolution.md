# Embryology as Proof of Evolution

Often the embryos of related species are very similar in appearance and structure. As the embryo grows, these similarities start to disappear. By comparing embryos, the relatedness of species can be observed.

For example: fish, bird, pig and human embryos all have:
- a nerve cord that develops into the spinal cord
- gill slits
- a fish-like heart
- a tail
