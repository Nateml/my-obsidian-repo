# How to Prioritize Tasks, or Not
Before starting with a task, we often like to go through all the tasks on our agenda and sort them according to priority. Often we waste a  lot of time doing this. This is especially the case when we have a lot of tasks, since this requires us going through every single one of them and deciding which is more important than the other.

A more efficient way of dealing with tasks is to simply tackle them at random, or perhaps in a chronological order (it doesn't really matter as long as you are not spending time ranking these tasks according to importance or difficulty or some other metric). For a larger set of tasks, it might make more sense to sort them into *priority buckets*. You spend a little time on grouping the tasks according to priority, but much less time than you would pitting each task against each other in a battle of their independent priority. When you get a new task, place it in a priority bucket and then at random (or by some other arbitrary metric) pick a task from that bucket and work on it.
