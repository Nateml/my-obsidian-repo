# How to be Productive as a Unorganised Person (Continuous Productivity)

As a person who finds it easiest to live their life in an unorganised manner, without a rigid structure, it can be very difficult to [[Time Management Collection|manage your time]] and to find ways to be productive. 

Many a time, we spend too much time trying to create and stick to a structure which we ultimately find unsustainable. We relapse on this structure and ultimately we have ended up wasting more time focusing on being productive than actually being productive. *This is not a natural productivity*. 

*Work from task to task*. If you have been studying for a maths exam for over an hour and you notice that your productivity is dropping off (or you feel in the mood to do another task where your productivity will be most actualised) then switch to something else. If you need to go grocery shopping, go grocery shopping. If you haven't gone to gym yet, go to the gym. Then after that, do the next thing... Respond to your emails. Then if you feel up to it, return to studying maths. The point is, **do not waste your time by burning yourself out on one task. Move from task to task, become naturally productive**.
