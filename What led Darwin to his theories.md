# What led Darwin to his theories 

Observations on a 5-year expedition to the southern hemisphere led to the formation of [Charles Darwin](Charles%20Darwin.md)'s theories. See [Evolution Theory](Evolution%20Theory.md) and [Natural Selection](Natural%20Selection).

See [Darwin's Mockingbird Observations](Darwin's%20Mockingbird%20Observations.md)

# Descent with modification

**Observations:**
- diversity among organisms
- variation of individiuals within a species
	- suggested that species undergo change
- different species in different countries despite similar climates

**Realisations:**
- earth was old
- geological change over time
- isolation leads to species changing

# Natural Selection
 
 **Darwin's four observations**
 
 1. Organisms produce more offspring than the environment can support.
 2. Natural variation within species.
	 1. Every organism is unique.
1. A change in the environment leads to the most suitably adapted organisms surviving and producing more offspring.
	1. See [Survival of the Fittest](Survival%20of%20the%20Fittest.md).
	2. Also called **differential reproduction**
