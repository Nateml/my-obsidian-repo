# Lamarckism

Proposed by [Jean-Baptiste Lamarck](Jean-Baptiste%20Lamarck.md).

Proposed that evolution was a natural phenomenon.

Organisms changed within their own lifetimes in order to survive new environments, these changes would then be inherited by offspring.

Example:
According to Lamarckism, the long neck and legs of a giraffes were the result of generations of short-necked and short-legged ancestors stretching their necks to feed on leaves at the top of trees at progressively higher levels.

### Problems with the Theory

Although Lamarck was correct about the environment producing phenotypic changes in an organism, he incorrectly believed that these changes would be passed on to offspring. Actual evolution is a much slower process than what Lamarckism suggests, since the evolution of organisms is mechanized by the gradual change in a species' gene pool ([Natural Selection](Natural%20Selection)), rather than the change of any specific organism during the course of a lifetime.s
