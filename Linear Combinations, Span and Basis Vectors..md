Each coordinate of a vector can be thought of as a scalar.

Basis vectors:
- $\hat{i}$ pointing to the right 1 unit
- $\hat{j}$ pointing upwards by 1 unit

x coord of vector scales i, y coord scales j.

Any vector can be described as the sum of two scaled basis vectors.

Choice of basis vectors affects coordinate system.

Linear combination of basis vectors.

The set of all possible vectors that you can reach with a linear combination of a given pair of vectors is the span of those two vectors.

vectors vs points
- it is common to represent a vector as a point in space, where its tip sits.

**Linear combination of vectors is choosing different scalars for each vector and adding them all together. When the vectors are represented as a matrix, then you get a linear combination of the columns of that matrix.** ^f48c4f

Linearly dependent vectors
	- When you have more than one vector and you could remove one of the vectors without changing the span.
	- When one of the vectors is a scaled version of the other vector (lies along the same plane).

Linearly independent vectors 
	- if each vector adds another dimension to the span.

The basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space.
