# Speciation

Refers to how new species are created. Directly linked to [Evolution Theory](Evolution%20Theory.md).

See [Types of Speciation](Types%20of%20Speciation.md).

Since species are defined as a group of organisms which breed with one another, any form of division or isolation which causes one group of organisms to not breed with another causes speciation. Generally speciation occurs when there is a physical or geographical division between a group of organisms of the same species ([Allopatric Speciation](Allopatric%20Speciation.md)). Following this division, there are [Stages of Speciation](Stages%20of%20Speciation.md).

Since species are defined as a group of organisms which breed with one another, reproductive isolation is ultimately what causes speciation. See [Mechanisms of Reproductive Isolation](Mechanisms%20of%20Reproductive%20Isolation.md).
