# Vector
> A physical quantity which has both magnitude and direction.

> In Linear Algebra, a vector is denoted by a single column matrix with a number of rows matching the dimensions of the [[Vector Space]] , which has entries which store the position the vector points to, from the origin.

Visualising matrices as a collection of vectors helps us understand how matrix transformations work ([[Visualising Matrix Operations as Transformations]]).

## Vector Operations
- [[Vector multiplication]]
- [[Vector Addition]]
- [[Vector Subtraction]]
- [[Vector Division]]
