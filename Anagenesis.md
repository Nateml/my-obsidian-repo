# Anagenesis

A type of [speciation](Speciation.md) whereby a single species slowly changes over time until it the organisms in the species are significantly different from their ancestors.

Note that this does not create a branch on a [phylogenetic tree](Phylogenetic%20Tree.md). Different to [cladogenesis](Cladogenesis.md) in this way.

Often anagenetic trends are associated with [micro-evolutionary trends](Microevolution.md).
