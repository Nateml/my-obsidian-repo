# Evidence for a Primate Common Ancestor

## Biogeographical Evidence

Primates are distributed across landmasses which were originally part of the Gondwanaland subcontinent, which split apart around 180 to 200 mya, indicating that primates shared a common ancestor here.

## Homologous features

Most primates today live in trees (arboreal), and have features which are suitably adapted for this habitat. Even primates that do not currently live in trees (like us humans) have arboreal adaptations, suggesting the primate common ancestor was arboreal.

Arboreal features:
1. Clavicle in collarbone which allows primates to support their weight when hanging by their arms.
2. Long, slender limbs which rotate freely (useful for tree movement).
3. Opposable thumbs to grasp onto branches easily.

See [Characteristics of Primates](Characteristics%20of%20Primates.md) for a list of common traits.

## Genetic Evidence

Primates share a large percentage of DNA with one another. Humans share 98.5% DNA with chimpanzees (closest relatives, [Hominini](Hominini.md)) and 93% with rhesus monkeys.
