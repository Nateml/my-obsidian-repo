# Basis Vectors
> The basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space.
 
$\hat{i}$ is the basis vector which points 1 unit to the right.
	- The horizontal unit vector
$\hat{j}$ is the basis vector which points 1 unit vertically.
	- The vertical unit vector

Given these basis vectors, any other vectors in 2d space can be described as a linear combination of the basis vector. This is another way of saying that the x-coordinate of a vector is $\hat{i}$ multiplied by a scalar, and the y-coordinate is $\hat{y}$ multiplied by a scalar.

For a vector space that goes above 2 dimensions, more basis vectors are required to span the full space.
