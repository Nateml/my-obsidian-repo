# DNA Transcription

First stage of [Protein Synthesis](Protein%20Synthesis.md) and the [Central Dogma of Molecular Biology](Central%20Dogma%20of%20Molecular%20Biology.md) which sees DNA being "transcribed" into a complimentary strand of RNA. The enzyme [Helicase](Helicase.md) "unzips" the DNA strand and then [RNA Polymerase](RNA%20Polymerase) synthesizes a complimentary RNA strand.
