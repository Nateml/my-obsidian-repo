# Homo (genus)

The genus to which modern humans ([Homo Sapiens](Homo%20Sapiens.md)) belong.
In the past, many species of _Homo_ existed, however all but the _Homo Sapiens_ have become extinct. 

The common ancestor of the _Homo_ genus is thought to be a member of the [Australopithecus genus](Australopithecus%20Genus.md), which then might have evolved into _homo erectus_. See [Out of Africa Hypothesis](Out%20of%20Africa%20Hypothesis.md).

## Taxonomy:

-	Family: [Hominidae](Hominidae.md)
-	Tribe: [Hominini](Hominini.md)

See [Taxonomic Classification System](Taxonomic%20Classification%20System.md)
