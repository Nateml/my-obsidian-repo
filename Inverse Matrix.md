# Inverse Matrix
> The matrix which transforms another matrix to an [[Identity Matrix]].

Not all matrices have inverses. Matrices which do have an inverse are called [[Invertible Matrices]].

In **square matrices**, multiplication of a matrix with its inverse will return the identity matrix no matter to which side of the matrix it's inverse is multiplied on.
$$A^{-1}A=AA^{-1}=I$$
This is not true for rectangular matrices.

You can use [[Gauss-Jordan Method of Finding the Inverse Matrix|Gauss-Jordan Method]] to find the inverse of an invertible matrix.
