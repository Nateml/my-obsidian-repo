# Progesterone Hormone

A hormone secreted by the [corpus leutem](Corpus%20Leutem.md) in [the ovaries](The%20Ovaries) during the second half of the menstrual cycle. Progesterone plays an important role in regulating the secretion of [luteinising hormone](Luteinising%20Hormone.md) in a negative feedback loop (See [Hormonal Control of Menstrual Cycle](Hormonal%20Control%20of%20Menstrual%20Cycle.md)).
