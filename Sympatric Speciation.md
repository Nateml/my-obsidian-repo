# Sympatric Speciation

A type of speciation which occurs when there are no physical barriers dividing organisms within a species, and the species live in a relatively small geographic area. Somehow speciation occurs spontaneously, although the exact reason why is up for scientific debate. Not all scientists believe that sympatric speciation even exists. The leading theory is that some organisms in the group become dependent on certain aspects of the environment while others do not. These differences compound and eventually these groups will no longer mate with one another.
