# Skew Symmetric Matrix
> A skew symmetric matrix is a square matrix $A$ which is equal to the negative of its [[The Transpose of a Matrix|transpose]].

$$A^T=-A$$
By the *negative* of matrix $A$, it is meant that for each entry $i,j$ in matrix $A$, the corresponding entry $i,j$ in matrix $A^T$ is the negative of that entry in $A$.

**All entries on the diagonal of a skew symmetric matrix are zero**
