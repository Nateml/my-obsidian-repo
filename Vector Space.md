# Vector Space
> A set of vectors which can be added together and multiplied by scalars, where the result of any of these operations should remain in the set.

There are many different vector spaces.

**$R^n$ is a vector space with vectors that have $n$ real components.**
	- E.g. $R^2$ (XY plane), $R^3$ (XYZ plane)

Smaller vector spaces can exist within one another. These vector spaces are called [[Vector Subspaces|vector subspaces]].
