# Vestigial Organs as Proof of Evolution

See [Vestigial Organs](Vestigial%20Organs.md).

Strong evidence for evolution since it would not make sense for an organism to independently evolve an organ which does not provide a useful function. The deduction is that vestigial organs would have had to be inherited from a common ancestor. We can tell how related we are to other species by looking at our vestigial organs.
