# Null Space
>The null space of a matrix $A$ is a set of all vectors which land on the zero vector (become null) after being transformed by $A$.

In $A\vec{x}=\vec{v}$, if $\vec{v}$ is $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$ then the null space contains all the solutions to that system of linear equations.
If the [[Determinant of a Matrix|determinant]] of $A$ is non-zero, then there will only be one vector $\vec{x}$ which will satisfy this equation, and thus the null space will only contain the zero vector. However, if the determinant is zero, then then then are an infinite number of vectors which can end up landing on the origin, since the [[Vector Space|vector space]] is being squished to a lower dimension.
