# The Interesting Behavior of Aphids

Aphids, commonly known as greenfly, are small insects which feed on the sap of plants. What makes these insects particularly interesting is the existence of "soldier" aphids who are anatomically different from non-soldier aphids. These soldiers are sterile and serve to protect the colony of aphids from threats, often sacrificing their lives in order to so. Why would such behavior arise, from an evolutionary perspective? How would the genes coding for the behavior of a soldier be passed on through generations of aphids, despite the soldiers themselves being sterile? The answer is that all the aphids in the colony, both soldiers and non-soldiers, share the same genetic makeup. That is to say that non-soldier aphids have the DNA for both soldier and non-soldier aphids, it is just that only the non-soldier DNA get's exhibited in their phenotype. The same can be said for soldier aphids, who also have DNA in their cells which codes for non-soldiers. At birth, the aphids seem to have a statistical chance of either developing into a soldier or a non-soldier. The soldier's, despite being sterile, protect the rest of the colony and thus protect copies of their genes. From the perspective of the gene, this behavior is still selfish, even though soldier aphids seem to behave altruistically at the level of the individual. The percentage of aphids which develop into soldiers could perhaps be a type of [Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS)](Evolutionary%20Stable%20Strategy%20(ESS).md). Some like to view a colony of aphids as being one single organism, and the soldier aphids could be regarded as doing something similar to our white blood cells.

There is more to aphids which make them interesting. They can produce both asexually and sexually, meaning lots of aphids are clones of one another, making them the only [eusocial organisms](Eusocial%20Organisms.md) to be clonal.
