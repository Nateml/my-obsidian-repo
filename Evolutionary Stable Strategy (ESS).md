# Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS)

An evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) is a strategy or state existing in a group of organisms which is considered evolutionary stable, that is to say that if there were a deviation from the strategy/state evolution would over time counteract this change until the strategy is stable again.

An ESS can be explained using [[Game Theory]].
