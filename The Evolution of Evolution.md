# The Evolution of Evolution

This note covers the evolving ideas regarding [Evolution Theory](Evolution%20Theory.md) and how species formed, from a historical perspective.

**Before 1700**

See [Young Earth Creationism](Creationism.md#Young-Earth%20Creationism) .

Note that creationism is a response to evolution theory and thus the beliefs prior to the publishing of On the Origin of Species by [Charles Darwin](Charles%20Darwin) cannot be strictly considered creationist, although the ideas were pretty much the same. 

Key points:
- Species were unrelated and remained unchanged since their creation by a divine power.
- Earth was around 6000 years old.

**1700 to early 1800**

Key figures:
- [Erasmus Darwin](Erasmus%20Darwin.md)
- [Jean-Baptiste Lamarck](Jean-Baptiste%20Lamarck.md)

Fossil studies and the study of the diversity of organisms led Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck to challenge the ideas of the time.

Key points:
- New theories by Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck proposed that species changed over time. The beginnings of evolution theory.
- Erasmus lacked a mechanism for evolution.
- Lamarck suggested that phenotypic changes of an organism due to their environment would be passed down to offspring.

**Early 1800 to early 1900**

[Charles Darwin](Charles%20Darwin) and [Alfred Russel Wallace](Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace.md) put forward the first acceptable mechanism for evolution.
