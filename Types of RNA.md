Multiple types of RNA exist which serve different functions.

## mRNA

Synthesised during [protein synthesis](Protein%20Synthesis.md). Corresponds to a section of DNA and travels out of the nucleus to be read by a ribosome and translated into an amino acid or protein. Contains codons which are groups of 3 DNA bases.

## tRNA

Small RNA molecules which transfer free amino acids in the cytoplasm of a cell to a ribosome for translation to take place. Consists of anticodons which are complimentary to the codons on an mRNA molecule.

## rRNA
