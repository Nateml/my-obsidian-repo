# Pivot of a Matrix
>The element of a matrix which is selected first by an algorithm to do certain calculations.

**The pivot has to be non-zero.** Finding the pivot is known as *pivoting*, which involves swapping rows of a matrix using [[Matrix Multiplication|multiplication]] of [[Permutation Matrix|permutation matrices]]. 

It is generally preferred to have a pivot with a large [[Absolute Values|absolute value]] in order to improve the numerical stability, i.e. to reduce the affect of round-off error.
