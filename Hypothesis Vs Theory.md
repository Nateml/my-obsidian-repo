# Hypothesis Vs Theory

In the scientific context, a theory is much more "proven" than a hypothesis. This is not to say a theory necessarily has to be proved as fact, but a theory does have to be widely accepted and have extensive evidence to support it. A theory should be able to stand up to thorough and repeated testing and be confirmed by independent peer review researchers. A hypothesis on the other hand is more of a suggestion or explanation which can either be proved or disproved through the [Scientific Method](Scientific%20Method.md). A hypothesis takes the form of a statement with a "if... then..." structure.
