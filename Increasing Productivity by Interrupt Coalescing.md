# Increasing Productivity by Interrupt Coalescing
[[Interrupt Coalescing|Interrupt coalescing]] is: ![[Interrupt Coalescing#^28a067]]
We can apply this to our own productivity as well. While working on a task, let's see studying for an exam, it is very easy to get distracted by other tasks which pop up to interrupt us. For example, we might receive an email and feel the urge to immediately reply to that email. These interruptions are a hindrance to our productivity. We should deal with these interruptions in a similar manner to which computers do, by quickly assessing the importance of an interruption, deciding on a time period that we can go without dealing with that interruption, and then only redirecting our focus towards that interruption after that time period is over. Let's say we get a few emails while we are studying for that exam. We can make the judgement that those emails are only worth responding to in an hour. Then, after an hour has passed, we can deal with those emails and then move on to studying for that exam, or moving on to another task.
