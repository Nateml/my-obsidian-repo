# What led Alfred Russel Wallace to his theories

[Alfred Russel Wallace](Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace.md) became puzzled over the differences in organisms living in the north-western and south-eastern regions of the Malay archipelago, despite their very similar climates. He concluded that geographical isolation resulted in [Speciation](Speciation.md). Wallace came up with [Natural Selection](Natural%20Selection) as a possible mechanism for this speciation. Him and  [Charles Darwin](Charles%20Darwin.md), who independently came up with the mechanism of natural selection, collaborated and published a joint paper.
