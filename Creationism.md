# Creationism

Creationism arose primarily as a response to [Evolution Theory](Evolution%20Theory.md) in the 18th century. Creationists believe that the world and the lifeforms which inhabit were created by god out of nothing. 

## Young-Earth Creationism

Young Earth creationists (YOCs) believe that everything on earth has remained as it was created by God around 6-10 thousand years ago. YOCs view God's 6 day creation of Earth from the [Book of Genesis](Book%20of%20Genesis.md) as a literal description of how the Earth and it's inhabiting lifeforms were made. They totally reject the idea of Evolution.
