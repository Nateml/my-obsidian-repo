# Darwin's Mockingbird Observations

A famous example of [biogeographical evidence for evolution](Biogeographical%20Evidence%20for%20Evolution.md).

On [Charles Darwin](Charles%20Darwin.md)'s trip to the Galapagos Islands, he noticed that on each island a unique species of mockingbirds existed. This was fascinating considering that he had only encountered three species of the bird on a 6400km trip down the South-American coast (Chile). Each species of mockingbird was somehow closer in appearance to the birds found on the island's nearest mainland, than to the birds living in the neighboring islands. This suggested that some time in the past, mockingbirds from the mainland had somehow reached the islands and evolved over time according to the specific environment of the island which they inhabited. It was evidence for [Allopatric Speciation](Allopatric%20Speciation.md) or perhaps [Peripatric Speciation](Peripatric%20Speciation.md). Importantly, the distribution of the species showed how physical barriers could cause [speciation](Speciation.md).

Key points:
1. Mockingbirds different on each island.
2. Birds more similar to birds on nearest mainland than neighboring islands.
3. Evidence for evolution.
