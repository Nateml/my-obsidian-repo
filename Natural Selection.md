# Natural Selection

The mechanism for evolution proposed by [Charles Darwin](Charles%20Darwin.md) and [Alfred Russel Wallace](Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace.md) in the 19th century.

A process by which nature selects organisms which are most suitably adapted to their environment. See [Survival of the Fittest](Survival%20of%20the%20Fittest.md).

Natural selection relies on genetic variation between organisms (see [Importance of Genetic Variation](Importance%20of%20Genetic%20Variation) and [Causes of Genetic Variation](Causes%20of%20Genetic%20Variation.md)) so that over time organisms with genes coding for "better" traits will be selected over those with "worse" traits.
