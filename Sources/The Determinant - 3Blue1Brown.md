Transformations can change the area formed by the [[Basis Vectors]]
If you know how the transformation changes the area of the unit square, then you can calculate how the transformation will affect any given area in the vector space.

The *determinant* is the "scaling factor". Determinant would be 3 if the transformation increases an area by 3.

Det is zero if it squishes space onto a line or a point.

Transformation which "flip space" invert the orientation of space, determinant is negative. Absolute value of determinant gives you the magnitude by which areas are scaled.

in 3D, det will tell you how much volume is scaled by. Use the 1x1x1 cube using the basis vectors. This cube is called parallelepiped. The determinant can be seen as the volume of the transformed parallelepiped.

right hand rule to describe orientation in 3D. If , after transformation, the same axis now have to be described by left hand, then the orientation of space has flipped and the determinant is negative.
