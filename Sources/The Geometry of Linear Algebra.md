Row picture:
- A (matrix of co-efficients) multiplied by the unknown vector = vector b 
- For each equation, plot 2 points which satisfy the equation and join them to form a line.
- Do this for each equation.
- The intersection of all the lines is the point at which the coordinates satisfy all of the equations.

Column picture:
- each unknown variable multiplied by vector of coefficients which appear in all equations
[08:58](https://youtu.be/J7DzL2_Na80#t=538.8375540095367)
- **linear combination of the columns**
	- multiply each column by some unknown number to produce a result 
[09:57](https://youtu.be/J7DzL2_Na80#t=597.5862409351502)
- draw the vectors and figure out how "many" (i.e the correct combination) of each vector will arrive at the "solution"

Can I solve $Ax=B$ for every $B$ ?
- Do the linear combinations of the columns fill the full dimensional space?
- If none of the column vectors lie along the same plane then there is always a solution for $Ax=B$ . (non singular matrix)

When I multiply a matrix by a vector I get a combination of the columns
