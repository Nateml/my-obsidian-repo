Any vector can be described as a linear combo of basis vectors.

Composition of two separate transformations can be described by a single transformation (linear combo of basis vectors).

To apply a rotation and then a shear, multiply target vector by a rotation matrix on the left of the vector, and then a shear matrix on the left of that operation.

However, the two separate matrices can be replaced by the product of the separate transformation matrices.

Reading right to left because of function notation.

$\hat{i}$ is the first column of the matrix on the right, which is then transformed by the matrix on its left.

First column of composition matrix equals left matrix multiplied by first column of right matrix

Second col of composition matrix is left matrix multiplied by second column of right matrix.

Does it matter what order we put the matrices in when we multiply them. YES. Transformation order matters.

By visualising matrix multiplication as a series of transformations, it becomes clear that matrix multiplication is associative. It does not matter which matrices you multiply first because the transformations will be the same.
