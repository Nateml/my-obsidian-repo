No clinical trials on dopamine detox.

Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that our brain uses to reinforce behaviour.
	- Not necessarily to experience pleasure.
	- Motivation and reward.
	- Makes us *want* stuff (reward-related cognition). 
	- Makes us want to *avoid* stuff (aversion-related cognition).

Mesolimbic pathway = motivation & reward
Mesocortical pathway = executive function (ability to plan out a task over time and execute on those pieces)

Executive function
	- we don't necessarily feel reward for the individual tasks which lead towards a goal

When people are too dopamine heavy, mesolimbic path dominates, people become unable to take action which is not immediately rewarding (instant gratification).
