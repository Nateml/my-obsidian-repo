What does elimination do?
[03:18](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=198.76962407629395)
- multiply the first equation by the right number and subtract it from the second equation in order to eliminate x from eq 2

The first pivot

Pivots are the numbers which are multiplied to get the correct subtraction to eliminate the desired variable from the next row.

Subtract the row to be reduced by a multiple of the "pivot row" until the matrix is triangular. 

Work with the left hand side before the right hand side (forward elimination).

Keep track of the positions and actions so that you can work backwards with the right hand side later on

The determinant of the matrix is the product of the pivots.

If there is a zero in the pivot position then can exchange rows to get a different number in the pivot position.

Follow the same operations with the right hand size ($B$ in $Ax=B$) to get vector $c$.
[16:12](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=972.3066510495911)
$Ax=B$ becomes $u=c$
[17:05](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=1025.5822279656677)

Once the matrix is triangulated you can solve the equations for each variable from bottom of the matrix to the top.

Backwards elimination

The result of multiplying a matrix by some vector is a combo of the columns of the matrix
[21:08](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=1268.540763196457)

A row vector multiplying a matrix is a row 
[22:19](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=1339.3251449008178)

matrix * column = column
[23:34](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=1414.5946939141693)
row * matrix = row
[23:47](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=1427.166951)

Matrix multiplication:
- column n of first matrix multiplies row n of second matrix
	- 1 0 0 would take 1 of first row and zero of next two rows
	- 0 1 0 would take 0 of first row, 1 of second row and 0 of third row
[26:07](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=1567.807072)

Identity matrix
[27:01](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=1621.6307399856948)


Checking an entry:
- Row 2 column 3 of the product, look at row 2 of matrix 1 and column 3 of matrix 2 and find dot product.
[28:11](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=1691.4702302832413)

Elementary (elimination) matrix is the matrix which you use to multiply to reduce a row in the matrix.
- E matrix notated with the subscript of the position of the value in the matrix which is used for the subtraction
[29:13](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=1753.853995)

$E_{32}(E_{21}A)=u$
[33:08](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=1988.59052)

Finding the matrix which completes the full elimination process.
- Multiply all the elimination matrices as seen in the above equation
* $(E_{32}E_{21})A=u$

Associative law
[35:42](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=2142.0935070534056)

Permutation matrix
- matrix which exchanges rows or columns
- it is like an identity matrix but with the position of the 1s swapped for the two rows that you want to swap
[36:59](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=2219.461559814987)

**Permutation matrix for column operation has to be on the right of the target matrix. For row operation it has to be on the left of the target  matrix**

Cannot exchange order of matrix multiplication.
[41:35](https://youtu.be/QVKj3LADCnA#t=2495.4519518130796)

Finding inverse matrices
	- matrix multiplied by its inverse equals identity matrix
	- $E^{-1}$
