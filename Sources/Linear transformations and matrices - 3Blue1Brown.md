Transformation takes in a vector and spits out another vector

Transformation suggests that u think about moving the input vector to the output vector.

A transformation is linear if:
- all lines remain lines (not curved)
- origin remains in place

The resultant vector $\vec{v}$ will be a linear combination of the two base vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ .

As long as we have were $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$  land, we can deduce where any vectors will land without needing to watch the transformation itself. (i.e. we can generalize the transformation).

Vector can be written with unknowns [x,y] and you can deduce where i land and j lands given any vector using the resulting formula.

 a 2d linear transform is completely described by the two coordinates for both i and j respectively.

2x2 matrix (column1 will be i and column2 will be j)
[06:27](https://youtu.be/kYB8IZa5AuE#t=387.8360689885559)

**Multiplying the 2x2 matrix by a vector will result in a linear combination of the columns, i.e. the base vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$.**

Linearly dependent = one vector is a scaled version of the other.
