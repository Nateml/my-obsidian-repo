Take the dot product of the first row of the first matrix and the first column in the second matrix to get the entry for position 1,1 (top left) in the product matrix.

**ProductMatrix(row, column) corresponds to Matrix1(row), Matrix2(column)**

The row position of matrix 1 corresponds with the row position of the product matrix
The column position of matrix 2 corresponds with the column position of the product matrix.
- Therefore the number of columns in matrix 1 needs to be equal to the number of rows in matrix 2 
- 2x2 and 2x2, 2x2 and 2x3
- Thus the product matrix will have the dimensions: rows of matrix 1 x columns of matrix 2
