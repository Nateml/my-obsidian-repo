# Augmented Matrix
>A type of [[Matrix|matrix]] obtained by appending the columns of two given matrices, in order to perform the same row operations on each matrix.

When solving a system of linear equations, the matrix of coefficients and the matrix of constants are appended. This is done in [[Gaussian Elimination]] and [[Gauss-Jordan Method of Finding the Inverse Matrix]].
