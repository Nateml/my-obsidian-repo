# Punctuated Equilibrium

Developed by [Stephen Jay Gould](Stephen%20Jay%20Gould.md), this model of evolution opposes [gradualism](Phyletic%20Gradualism.md) and states that speciation occurs in a relatively short time span, which is followed by long periods of equilibrium. Fossil evidence supports this model: Gould found fossils of species which did not change for millions of years, which would then be followed or preceded by (punctuated by) periods of time where fossils exhibited drastic change. The absence of transitional fossils (missing links) supports this model.
