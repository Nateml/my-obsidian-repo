# Biogeographical Evidence for Evolution

See [Biogeography](Biogeography.md).

- Similar species tend to be geographically clustered, indicating that species might have descended from ancestral species and thus more related species would be found nearby one another.

- Differences in species living in regions with similar climates (along same latitude). See [What led Darwin to his theories](What%20led%20Darwin%20to%20his%20theories.md). Indicates that species descended from ancestral species living in the region who were different from those living in other regions. [Is Evolution Inevitable](Is%20Evolution%20Inevitable.md).

- Species differ on each island on an archipelago. See [What led Darwin to his theories](What%20led%20Darwin%20to%20his%20theories.md).
	- Island species more closely related to species on nearest mainland than species on nearby islands.
