# Genetic Drift

A change in the frequency of an allele in a population of organisms due to a random sampling of organisms from a larger group. This random sampling can cause a slight change in the frequency of certain alleles in the new sampled population group. If the initial frequency of the allele was small, then the effects of genetic drift can be greater; the frequency of the allele in the sampled group could become zero or so small that it dissapears completely. Genetic drift can contribute to reducing genetic variation. See the [Importance of Genetic Variation](Importance%20of%20Genetic%20Variation.md).

Genetic drift can be seen in [Peripatric Speciation](Peripatric%20Speciation.md).
