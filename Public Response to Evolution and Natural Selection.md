# Public Response to Evolution and Natural Selection

After the publication of _On the Origin of Species_ (See [Charles Darwin](Charles%20Darwin.md), within a few decades most scientists accepted evolution and the idea of a common ancestor as correct. However the mechanism Darwin proposed, [Natural Selection](Natural%20Selection), only truly became accepted as a realistic explanation after the discovery of genes and mutations in the 20th century. Many people in the late 19th century, even those who claimed to be Darwinist, actually believed in a form of [Lamarckism](Lamarckism.md).
