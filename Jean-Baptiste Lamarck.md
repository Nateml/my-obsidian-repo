# Jean-Baptiste Lamarck

1774-1829

Published _Philosophie Zoologique_ (1809), where he proposed that species changed over time.

Key observations which led to his theory:
-	fossils are different from living species
-	domestication/selected breeding resulted in animals and plants changing
-	characteristics of plants would change after cross-breeding
