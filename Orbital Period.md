# Orbital Period
The time it takes for a body to orbit around a point. 

Can be represented by a differential equation, where the x and y values are functions of time.

Orbital distance is going to be equal to the circumference of the circle, i.e. $2\pi r$ 
Thus the orbital period can be calculated in terms of r if velocity is known.

period = circum / velocity
