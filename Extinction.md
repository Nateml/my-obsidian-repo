# Extinction

When a species is terminated (ceases to exist) due to some environmental forces. Often times of increased environmental pressure causes mass extinctions to take place. 

All organisms have a change of going extinct, especially if they are less adapted to face increased environmental pressures. See [Survival of the Fittest](Survival%20of%20the%20Fittest.md).
