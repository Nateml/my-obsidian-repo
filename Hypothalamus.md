# Hypothalamus

The lower central part of the brain. 

Plays an important part in [The Endocrine System](The%20Endocrine%20System.md), by mechanising communication between the nervous system and the endocrine system. The hypothalamus translates stimuli interpreted by the brain into chemicals which controls the [pituitary gland](Pituitary%20Gland).
