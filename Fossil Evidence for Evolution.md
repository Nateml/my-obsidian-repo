# Fossil Evidence for Evolution

Species alive today can be traced back through fossils found in varying ages of rock. Rocks with fossils in them can be radiometrically dated and thus a sequential record of fossils can be produced. Since rocks can be dated up to 3.5 billion years old, the process of evolution can be observed.

Increasing complexity can be seen by looking at chronologically sequenced fossils over millions of years (first [prokaryotes](Prokaryotes.md) 3.6 bya to humans today).
