# Out of Africa Hypothesis

A hypothesis ([Hypothesis Vs Theory](Hypothesis%20Vs%20Theory.md)) which explains the distribution of homos around the world.

Around 1.8 million years ago, Homo erectus (upright man) left Africa via the [Levantine Corridor](Levantine%20Corridor.md) and migrated to Eurasia and gave rise to homo neanderthals. Years later, [Homo Sapiens](Homo%20Sapiens.md) left Africa for Europe and other parts of the world. Homo species which existed in other areas went extinct, leaving homo sapiens as the only member of the homo genus.
