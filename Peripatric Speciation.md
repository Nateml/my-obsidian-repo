# Peripatric Speciation

A type of [Speciation](Speciation.md) which refers to when a small group of organisms in a species seperate from the original group of species, typically due to a physical/geographical boundary such as a the division of a landform, such that the new group cannot breed with the original species. Peripatric speciation is very similar to [allopatric speciation](Allopatric%20Speciation.md).

Distinguishing features:
1. small size of the isolated population
2. strong selection pressures on isolated population due to colonization of new environment
3. noticeable effects of [genetic drift](Genetic%20Drift.md) on isolated population
