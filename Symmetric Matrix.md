# Symmetric Matrix
> A symmetric matrix is a matrix which has a [[The Transpose of a Matrix|transpose]] equal to itself.

$$A^T=A$$
## How to get a symmetric matrix
The product of a rectangular matrix and its transpose is always symmetric.
$R^TR$ is symmetric.

![[Transpose of a Product of Matrices#^9cb36b]]

From the information above, we can write that the transpose of $R^TR$ is:
$$(R^TR)^T=R^T(R^T)^T=R^TR$$
We can see that the transpose of $R^TR$ is equal to $R^TR$ and therefore is symmetric.
