# Phyletic Gradualism


Originally put forward by [Charles Darwin](Charles%20Darwin.md) (also see [Darwin's Explanation of Descent with Modification](Darwin's%20Explanation%20of%20Descent%20with%20Modification.md)), the gradualism [hypothesis](Hypothesis%20Vs%20Theory.md) suggests that species evolve due to the accumulation of gradual changes over a long period of time. Human's are thought to have evolved according to this model because of our fossil record (see [Fossil Evidence for Evolution](Fossil%20Evidence%20for%20Evolution.md)).

This is in contrast to the [Punctuated Equilibrium](Punctuated%20Equilibrium) model of evolution.
