# Identity Matrix
> A matrix which, when multiplied by another matrix $B$, keeps matrix $B$ the exact same.

### Explanation
The only non-zero entries in an identity matrix are a diagonal of 1s, starting from position 0,0.

The column of the singular value in each row corresponds with the position of the row.
Look at [[Matrix Multiplication]] to see how this doesn't change the target matrix.
