# Parapatric Speciation

A type of [speciation](Speciation.md) which refers to when a species is spread out over a large geographical area and technically can breed with one another, however organisms tend to breed with those in a smaller region close to them. Environmental changes in these smaller regions cause groups of the organisms to display different traits and speciation eventually occurs. Different to [Allopatric Speciation](Allopatric%20Speciation.md) and [Peripatric Speciation](Peripatric%20Speciation.md) since there is no physical barrier dividing organisms in the species.
