# Linearly Dependent Vectors

>Vectors which are scaled versions of one another.

Vectors which are linearly dependent point in the same direction. Their magnitudes may differ, but their direction remains the same. Because of this, there is no amount of combinations of these vectors which will fill the whole [[Vector Space|vector space]]. 

This leads to a more technical definition:

>A set of more than 1 vector in which a vector may be removed without the [[Span of Vectors|span]] changing.
