# Oral creatine supplementation improves brain performance

Study shows significantly improved performance in cognitive tests (Raven's Advanced Program Matrices (RAPM) and Wechsler Auditory backward digit span (BDS))  after 6 week periods of creatine supplementation ($5\ g.d^{-1}$)

Note that the subjects were vegetarian or vegan and thus likely had lower natural levels of creatine to begin with, making the effects of creatine potentially more drastic than if the subjects were red meat eaters.

Results (extracted from article):

> Mean BDS under the placebo was 7.05 items (s.d. = 1.19), compared with a mean of 8.5 items under creatine treatment (s.d. = 1.76)

> The mean RAPMs raw score under placebo was 9.7 (s.d. = 3.8) items correct in 10 min versus 13.7 (s.d. = 4.1) items correct under the experimental treatment.
