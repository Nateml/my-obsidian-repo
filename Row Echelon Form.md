# Row Echelon Form
A type of [[Echelon Form]].

Row echelon form is not unique. A matrix has an infinite number of row echelon forms. Any matrix which is in row echelon form can be put in an equivalent

## Requirements:
1. The first non-zero number from the left (the *leading coefficient*, or the *[[Pivot of a Matrix|pivot]]*) is always to the right of the first non-zero number in the row above.
2. Rows consisting of all zeros are at the bottom of the matrix.

Some textbooks require the leading coefficient to be a 1.

## [[Pseudocode for Row Echelon Form|Pseudocode for row echelon form]]

The matrix is said to be in *triangulated form*.
