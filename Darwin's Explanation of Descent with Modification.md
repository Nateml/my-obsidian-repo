# Darwin's Explanation of Descent with Modification

Relates species have a common ancestor which existed long ago. These ancestral species became exposed to different environmental factors which they adapted to, creating diversity and change in species over time. Species would split into new species as they adapted to their environments, while some species would die out (become extinct).
