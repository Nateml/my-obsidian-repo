# Determinant of a Matrix
>The determinant is the "scaling factor" of a transformation. 

*Note that the term "area" applies to 2 dimensional shapes. However, in this note the concept of area will remain valid for all dimensions, it is the product of where vectors land.*

The determinant of a matrix $A$ would therefore be the factor by which the area formed by the [[Basis Vectors|basis vectors]] changes after being transformed by matrix $A$.
![[Visualising Matrix Operations as Transformations#^0ea807]]
The above information allows us to see how matrix $A$ is essentially just the transformation of the basis vectors. Therefore the determinant of the matrix would just be the area formed by the column vectors of this matrix.

### Negative Determinants
A determinant which is negative can be seen as "flipping space". The [[Absolute Values|absolute value]] of the determinant will give you the *magnitude* by which areas are scaled, while the sign will tell you if space has been flipped or not.
