# The Mind as a Virtual Machine

This idea bases itself in the common analogy between computers and our brains. This idea particularly focuses on the concept of [Virtualisation](Virtualisation.md). In the same way that computer's create a virtual front-end for user's to interact with it, the "hardware" of our brain, the complex network of neurons, creates a virtualization for us to comprehend. The idea is that this is related to the consciousness of an organism. If our brain can create a virtual model of itself, then through simulation we can gain an intuition for the behavior of other organisms with similar brains. For social animals like ourselves, this "natural" psychology is a very useful trait to have. 

Another part of this idea is that our brain's compute in a parallel manner, however the virtualisation that we comprehend is serial or linear. Perhaps this developed in a response to the type of tasks humans have to do, however we don't really have a good explanation for why we should think linearly.
