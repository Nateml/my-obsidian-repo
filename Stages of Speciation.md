# Stages of Speciation

1. Division of habitat
	1. Organisms start living in different habitats (e.g. trees vs ground)
2. Division of food resources
	1. As competition for food increases, groups of organisms explore different feeding niches. These organisms adapt to the food source. ([Natural Selection](Natural%20Selection.md))
3. Division by sexual selection
	1. Organisms begin to develop different mating behaviors, leading to [reproductive isolation](Mechanisms%20of%20Reproductive%20Isolation.md).
