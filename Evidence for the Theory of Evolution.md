1. [Fossil records](Fossil%20Evidence%20for%20Evolution.md)
2. [Biogeography](Biogeographical%20Evidence%20for%20Evolution.md)
3. [Genetics ](Genetic%20Evidence%20for%20Evolution.md)
4. Homologies (similar characteristics due to relatedness). See [Comparative Anatomy as Proof of Evolution](Comparative%20Anatomy%20as%20Proof%20of%20Evolution.md)
5. [Embryology as Proof of Evolution](Embryology%20as%20Proof%20of%20Evolution.md)
6. [Vestigial Organs](Vestigial%20Organs.md)
7. Biodiversity
8. Physiology

The above makes evolution a scientific theory as opposed to a hypothesis. See [Hypothesis Vs Theory](Hypothesis%20Vs%20Theory.md).
