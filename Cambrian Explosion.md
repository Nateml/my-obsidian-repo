# Cambrian Explosion

A period of rapid diversification of organisms on Earth. Approximately 545 million years ago, unicellular organisms evolved into complex multicellular organisms. The [Metazoan](Metazoa.md) common ancestor is believed to have existed prior to this "explosion".

The Cambrian explosion lasted aprox 5-10 million years, while the Cambrian period lasted longer. See [Geological Time Scale](Geological%20Time%20Scale.md).
