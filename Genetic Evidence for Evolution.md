# Genetic Evidence for Evolution

See [Genetics](Genetics.md).

The fact that all organisms use DNA and RNA as "genetic code" indicates a common ancestor. 
Genes coding for common proteins across all organisms.

Sequences of chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA can be compared between species to understand how related they are. This can tell us how long ago we shared a common ancestor with another species by creating a map of relatedness between many species.
