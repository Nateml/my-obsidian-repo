# RNA Translation

Second step in [Protein Synthesis](Protein%20Synthesis.md) which sees mRNA being "decoded" or translated into a series of amino acids, completing the [Central Dogma of Molecular Biology](Central%20Dogma%20of%20Molecular%20Biology.md). 

mRNA is translated in a ribosome by tRNA, which has an anti-codon at one end and an amino acid on the other end. The anti-codon identifies the amino acid that belongs to it. Since anti-codons compliment with the codons on mRNA, the mRNA can be read and the corresponding amino acids can form a chain as each codon matches up with an anti-codon on the tRNA and thus the amino acid it codes for. The amino acids are connected through a condensation reaction. This amino acid chain is known as a polypeptide or a protein if it is long enough (50 or more amino acids).
