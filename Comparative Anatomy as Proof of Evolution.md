# Comparative Anatomy as Proof of Evolution

Common structures between species which evolved from a common ancestor are called **homologies**. The more homologies between species, the more related the species is. These common structures can act as proof of a common ancestor. This is known as [divergent evolution](Divergent%20Evolution.md).

**Analogous structures** are common structures between species which have independently evolved that structure due to similar environmental factors. This is not evidence for evolution. Example being that both bats and insects have wings, however this is not because of common ancestry. Known as [convergent evolution](Convergent%20Evolution.md)
